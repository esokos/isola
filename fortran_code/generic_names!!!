IMPORTANT NOTICE 
GUI does not enable option of the codes. In the present distribution we have
chosen always one of the existing versions. Using another version would
require that user goes to this folder, and manually copies some version
into generic file, e.g. he/she copies isola2018_interaction.exe into isola.exe.
Consultation with authors is recommended.
