Isola2024 is update of isola2022.

For those who used isola2022, the transition to isola2024
only means to download isola_FORTRAN_2024 and isola_GUI_2024
and put them on the Windows system path in the same way as the 2022 version.

The 2024 update aims at improving moment tensors and their uncertainty assessment.

While isola2022 used a single-value constant-diagonal covariance matrix, 
isola2024 is equipped with three more general covariance matrices, 
available as option in Run of the Waveform Inversion tool.
The same matrices are used in updated tool Uncertainty Assessment.
It is assumed that data error is represented by waveform residuals = observed minus synthetic.

The 2024 version is accompanied by six detailed tutorials (examples).

During the year 2024, we shall prepare a paper describing theory and tests of the new methodology.
