ISOLA - a manual tool aimed at understanding (and teaching) moment-tensor inversion
using full waveforms, envelopes, and polarities. 

The tool is especially useful for solving specific challenging events requiring easy 
and quick run of many-times repeated inversion tests. 

ISOLA name comes from 'isolated asperities', because one of the most efficient applications
is the multiple-point-source (MPS) modeling, which is a useful first approximation
before performing more sophisticated finite-fault slip inversions with other codes.

Maximum number of used stations: 21

The software is primarily intended for Windows users. 

Optimally, users should use the provided exe files, not compiling code themselves.

Recommended: Intel oneAPI and Visual Studio.
